AJAX/API LAB POOR MAN’S REDDIT Task:
  Create a webpage that displays the posts from the AWW Subreddit.
  
  Build Speciﬁcations  
    1. Use jQuery to request data from the  https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/.json  API.  
    2. Display the results on the page.  
    3. At a minimum, include a title, image and working link for each post. (Easiest is to use the  thumbnail for the image, but there are other images in the JSON response.)  
    4. Make it look good with some CSS.   (look good is quite open and relative... liberties were taken) 
    
    Bonus:  Only show the ﬁrst ten results
